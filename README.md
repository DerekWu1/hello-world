It is at this point in time of our hero's life that he realised that something needed to change. Familiarity and comfort no longer satisfied his soul, for it now longed for a more exciting life, one that a person can look back on and think, "wow, I really did that huh". 

But a fulfilling and interesting life does not come easy. If our hero wanted a fulfilling life, he knew that he would have to work hard for it, just like the other heroes before him did. Our hero got to work. He explored the world, to see what passsions and interests moved his soul the most. Helping people, he thought, was something he could commit himself to, and do forever. He had loved to be of use and help ever since he was young. But help people how? This was the hard part. Our hero had lived a relatively easy going suburban lifestyle, and had never truly been challenged before.
